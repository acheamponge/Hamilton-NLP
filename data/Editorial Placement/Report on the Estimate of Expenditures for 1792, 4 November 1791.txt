The first, relating to the Civil List, or the expenditure for the support of Government during the year 1792, (including incidental and contingent expenses of the several departments and offices) amount to	328.653.56.
The second, relating to certain liquidated claims upon the treasury; to certain deficiencies in former estimates for the current service, and to a provision in aid of the fund heretofore appropriated for the payment of certain officers of the Courts, Jurors, witnesses &c	197.119.49.
The third, relating to the department of War, shewing the stated expenditure of that department, for the year 1792	357.731.61.
The amount of a year’s pensions to invalids	87.463.60⅔
Pay and subsistence to sundry officers, for which no appropriation has yet been made,	10.490.36.
Arrearages due upon Indian affairs for the year 1791, and the sum supposed to be necessary for the year 1792	39.424.71
Expenses incurred for the defensive protection of the frontiers for the years 1790 and 1791, and for which no appropriation has yet been made	37.339.48.
     Amounting together to, Dollars,	1.058.222.81⅔
As appears by Number 4, which contains a summary of the three preceding ones, exhibiting in one view the total sum, as above stated, for which an appropriation is requisite.

The funds, out of which the said appropriation may be made, are, first, the sum of six hundred thousand dollars reserved annually out of the duties on imports and tonnage, by the Act making provision for the debt of the United States, for the support of the government thereof:3 And secondly, such surplus as shall have accrued to the end of the present year, upon the revenues heretofore established, over and above the sums necessary for the payment of interest on the public debt during the same year, and for the satisfying of other prior appropriations.

Judging from the returns heretofore received at the Treasury, there is good ground to conclude, that that surplus, together with the above-mentioned sum of six hundred thousand dollars, will be adequate to the object.

All which is humbly submitted

Alexr. Hamilton
Secretary of the Treasury.
