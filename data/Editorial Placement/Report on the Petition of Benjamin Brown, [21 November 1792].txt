[Philadelphia, November 21, 1792
Communicated on November 22, 1792]1
[To the Speaker of the House of Representatives]
The Secretary of the Treasury, to whom was referred, by the House of Representatives, the petition of Benjamin Brown,2 submits the following Report thereupon.

The Act of the last Session, entitled “An Act providing for the settlement of the claims of persons under particular circumstances barred by the limitations heretofore established,”3 removes all obstacles to the claim of the petitioner, arising from the Acts of limitation4 if otherwise well founded.

But it appears, that Peter Greene, Attorney to Benjamin Brown, received, on the 13th of August 1788, a Certificate from the Commissioner for settling the accounts of the Marine Department, for the balance of pay due to said Brown for his services on board the Frigate Trumbull; which satisfies the claim of the petitioner.

Respectfully submitted,

Alexander Hamilton
Secry of the Treasry.

November 21st 1792.
