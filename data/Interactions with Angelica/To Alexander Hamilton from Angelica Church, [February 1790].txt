Many thanks to my dear Brother for having written to his friend at a moment when he had the affairs of America on his mind;1 I am impatient to hear in what manner your Budget has been received and extremely anxious for your success.

I sometimes think you have now forgot me and that having seen me is like a dream which you can scarcely believe. Adieu I will not write this idea of being lost in the tumult of business and ambition does not enliven my spiritsâ€”adieu soy ez heureux au dessus de tout le monde.
