Are you too happy to think of us? Ah petit Fripon you do not believe it:â€”no I am not too happy, can I be so on this side of the Atlantic? ask your heart, and read my answer there.

My silence is caused by dispair; for do not years, days and moments pass and still find me separated from those I love! yet were I in America, would ambition give an hour to Betsey and to me. Can a mind engaged by Glory taste of peace and ease?

You and Betsey in England. I have no ideas for such happiness, but when will you come and receive the tears of joy and affection?

Your devoted

Angelica
