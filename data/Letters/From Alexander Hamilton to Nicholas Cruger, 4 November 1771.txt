Dear Sir
I wrote you a few days ago by Capt Codwise2 to which refer you & should send you Copys by this opportunity but I am so unwell that it is with difficulty I make out to write these few lines. Every thing remains as then advisd. I have sold about 30 bbls flour more & Collectd a little more money from different people.

The Major3 lies so ill that no one expects he’ll live till night.

I receiv’d a Letter from Mr. Thomas Ashburner mentioning that Mr. Thomas Thomas4 was gone to New York but that he had receivd the money from Mr. A. Heyliger5 before his departure. Accordingly I have orderd it down in joes6 which is the only thing that would answer just now. Not a word from Curraica yet, nor no appearance of your New Sloop.

I remain with the most permanent Esteem D. Sir

Your very H Serv
