We the Subscribers do certify that Col Ebenezer Stevens was together with ourselves appointed by the Citizens of this City a Committee to devise and cause to be erected fortifications for its immediate Defenceâ€”that Col Stevens in the course of the execution of this trust was charged with a particular superintendence of the execution of the works and with a variety of details which occasioned to him extraordinary trouble occupying a great portion of his time for which he is well intitled to an adequate compensation.
