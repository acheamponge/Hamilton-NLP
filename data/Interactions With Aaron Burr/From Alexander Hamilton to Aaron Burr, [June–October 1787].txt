[New York, June-October, 1787.]1 “As I wished the cause of Bayard vs Breese2 and others to be regularly at issue & as the Chancellor could not readily be come at to procure from him an order to serve subpoenas on the Clerk in Court, I sent you a request some time since3 to file rejoinders.… I have not, however, received any notice of its having been done. I will thank you particularly to have it done in the course of the day.…”
