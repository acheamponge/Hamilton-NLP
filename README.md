# Hamilton-NLP
A Natural Language Processing project for focused on the letters and writings associated with American founding father Alexander Hamilton and featured in the Hamilton Broadway Play.

In this project, I decided to utilize the NLP API on the Google Cloud Platform instead of using open source modules.

"Why do you write like you're running out of time?" - Nonstop (From Hamilton play)

### - Data
Data was scraped from Founders Online (https://founders.archives.gov/) and include:
- Hamilton's interactions with Aaron Burr.

- Pandas
- Counter 
- Google Cloud Language Python API
- Plotly
- Pillow
- WordCloud
- Matplotlib 


### - NLP techniques Used
- Sentiment Analysis
- Entity Analysis
- Syntax Analysis
- Text Classification


### - Graphs Used
- Pie Charts
- Word Clouds

### - How to run the notebook:
- Set up Google Cloud Account
- Create a configuration file for Google Cloud Natural Language API and save it at as JSON file
- Make sure all the Technologies above are installed
- Run each cell

### - Some Issues you might encounter
- Installing google-cloud does not work you have to specifically install google-cloud-language in order to get the import module to work
- In order to get access to the Google NLP API, you need the credentials or else it won't work. I set it as a variable in my code but there are other ways to do it.


NB: You can listen to the Hamilton Album as you work on it.
